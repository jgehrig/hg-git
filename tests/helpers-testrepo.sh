# markers by default.

# If test-repo includes evolution markers, and we do not enable evolution
# markers, hg will occasionally complain when it notices them, which disrupts
# tests resulting in sporadic failures.

# Since we aren't performing any write operations on the test-repo, there's
# no harm in telling hg that we support evolution markers, which is what the
# following lines for the hgrc file do:
