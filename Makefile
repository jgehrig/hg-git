# This is intended to be the authoritative list of Hg versions that this
# extension is tested with.  Versions prior to the version that ships in the
# latest Ubuntu LTS release (2.8.2 for 14.04 LTS) may be dropped if they
# interfere with new development.  The latest released minor version should be
# listed for each major version; earlier minor versions are not needed.
# Mercurial 3.4 had a core bug that caused a harmless test failure -- 3.4.1
# fixes that bug.
