GitHug, the Hg-Git Plugin
=========================

This plugin is designed to allow you to push to a Git server over the Git 
protocol and to pull from a Git based project.  All data is stored in Hg
native format with a mapping table.  People collaborating in Git should not 
even be able to tell that you're using Hg to collaborate on their project. 
Nothing should be kept in the Git format except perhaps for caching.

(Dulwich library)

May need to use bookmarks extension to do everything better.

* Cloning from a Git Repository *

hg init, hg add remote, hg gfetch, hg checkout

* Fetching from a Git Repository *

hg gremote add (git-url)

hg gfetch origin (like a hg pull)
 - connects to server (upload-pack)
 - gets a list of server shas
 - sees what it does not have (maps all unmapped shas, checks list)
 - requests needed shas
 - fetches packfile
    - explodes
    - converts parent linages to hg changesets
    - updates local parents

* Pushing to a Git Repository *

hg gpush origin
  - maps all unmapped shas
  - connects to server
  - needs/haves
  - creates packfile of git versions of everything the server needs
  - transfers it, updates local references (bookmarks?)
