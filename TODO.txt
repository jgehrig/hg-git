GENERAL
==========
* respect file modes on conversions
* explicit file renames
* more tests
* submodules?
* .gitignore, etc - try to convert? 
  - (probably not automatically, but perhaps a generator?)

PUSH
==========

Getting (and not sure why):
  error: Ref refs/heads/master is at 093772e7fa2ee3c0d488bc44317cfe66d72f09ed  
         but expected a89be0ca4c09782b6275a8e826c11a91b860a071
  error: failed to lock refs/heads/master
  (it works, but why is it doing this?)

* push with branch names (w/ proper error messages)
* update 'remote' references after push confirmation
* push confirmation? is there extra data after the packfile upload?
* output something after process is complete (master -> master etc)
  - explain what branch mapping policy determined
* convert tags to git
* octopus merge explode re-implode

FETCH
===========
* add removed files to filechanged and raise IOError
* gfetch command
* only try to import non-mapped commits
* tag conversion
* save git metadata (committers, unless it's the same) as extra info
* octopus merge explode

SPEED/EFFICIENCY
================
* switch object mapping to hg->git since the many to one is that direction
* don't send blobs/trees already on server

MILESTONES
=============
* Hg<->Git<->Hg
  - create a repo in Hg
  - push to a Git server
  - clone into another Hg client
  - verify that the node ids are identical
