CLONE

FETCH
===========

* gfetch command
* some sort of remote management

PUSH

* get a list of all the hg changesets not yet mapped
* create git objects from each changeset (incl trees/blobs)
  - add metadata to commits (branch names, explicit file names)
* update mapfile with new changeset/commit mapping
* connect to server pushing to
  - figure out needs (use heads/bookmarks for haves)
* create packfile with needed objects
  - some delta compression if possible (?)
* upload packfile, remove temp packfile
