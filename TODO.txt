GENERAL
==========
* fully integrate as native protocol handler
  - hg push git@...
  - hg fetch [remote] (remote is url, hg alias or hg-git remote)
  - hg clone url
* fail nicely when the remote_name is not there
* submodules?
* .gitignore, etc - try to convert? 
  - (probably not automatically, but perhaps a generator?)

PUSH
==========
* push with branch names (w/ proper error messages)
* explain what branch mapping policy determined when updating refs
* convert tags to git (local and .hgtags entries)
* add a warning for a non-fast forward push

FETCH
===========
* tag conversion (add local tags if not already in .hgtags)

MAPPING ISSUES
==============
Created in Hg:
* merges with renames in 2nd branch
  - dont convert back properly for some reason

Created in Git:
* different committer in Git objects
* encoding field
* octopus merge explode/implode

WEBSITE
===========
* more usage documentation
* screencast

SPEED/EFFICIENCY
================
* switch object mapping to hg->git since the many to one is that direction
* don't send blobs/trees already on server
* packfile creation benchmarking (seems to take a while sometimes)
  - at least provide status output
