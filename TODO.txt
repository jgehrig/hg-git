GENERAL
==========
* integrate as native protocol handler (hg push git://...)
* more tests
* submodules?
* .gitignore, etc - try to convert? 
  - (probably not automatically, but perhaps a generator?)

PUSH
==========
* push with branch names (w/ proper error messages)
* explain what branch mapping policy determined when updating refs
* convert tags to git

FETCH
===========
* gfetch command
* only try to import non-mapped commits
* tag conversion

MAPPING ISSUES
==============
Created in Hg:
* explicit file renames
* named branches

Created in Git:
* octopus merge explode/implode
* different committer in Git objects


SPEED/EFFICIENCY
================
* switch object mapping to hg->git since the many to one is that direction
* don't send blobs/trees already on server
* packfile creation benchmarking (seems to take a while sometimes)
